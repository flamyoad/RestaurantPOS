# Prototype POS System

One of the lengthy projects that I did in my early days of coding. 
It is coded in [WPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation). 

No libraries are used in the making of this project as I was still young & naive and did not know about libraries back then. ðŸ˜´
